# Photogrammetric-Potsherd-Profile
A procedure for using photography to estimate key artifact dimensions 
## Overview
* Set the stage
* Place the artifact on a turntable and take photographs at 10-degree intervals
* Convert the image files to a pointcloud
* Convert the pointcloud to a stereolithography model
* Manipulate and measure the model

## Details
### Set the Stage
* Select a location with plenty of natural light
* Put dark paper or cloth under and behind the turntable to serve as a backdrop
* Attach the camera to a tripod and adjust the height so the center of the lense is at the same height as the center of the artifact to be photographed
